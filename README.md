>A custom plugin/scripting enabled server for 7 Days To Die

## What?
Basically, 7 Days To Die's only server is very basic (not to the fault of the devs, it's all in Unity). This is an attempt at making a plugin enabled server, allowing for servers to have more custom 
content for users to enjoy, but also things like admin tools. 

## Installation
Coming soon&trade;

## Development Setup
Coming soon&trade;

## License
7 Days To Die is owned by The Fun Pimps, Ethyr isn't related to them, blah blah blah. I'm doing this all from scratch, but everyone is free to contribute/fork.
